  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses most requirements related to user authentication and progress saving. Backend functions for user profile management, quiz results, and bookmarks are implemented. Frontend components for quiz saving, bookmark functionality, profile page, and login page enhancements are all present. However, there is a minor gap in supporting degree bookmarks separately from career bookmarks in the backend, as the implementation appears to use a unified bookmark system without type differentiation.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Add backend functions to save and retrieve bookmarked career paths and degree programs for authenticated users",
      "reason": "The backend implementation in main.mo uses a single Set<Nat> for bookmarks without distinguishing between career paths and degree programs. The acceptance criteria require separate handling or at least type identification for career path or degree, but the current implementation treats all bookmarked items as a single undifferentiated collection. While addBookmark and removeBookmark functions exist, there is no mechanism to retrieve bookmarks by type (career vs degree) or store metadata indicating what type each bookmark represents.",
