  "summary": "The diff shows only 3 modified files (Navigation.tsx, frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json), but the BuildRequest requires updates to 5+ specific files across frontend and backend. Critical files like index.html, Home.tsx, About.tsx, and backend/main.mo are missing from the diff entirely. The Navigation.tsx change correctly shows 'CareerSphere' branding, and the file summaries indicate other files already contain 'CareerSphere', but no evidence of actual text replacements from 'career guide' to 'CareerSphere' is present in the diff.",
