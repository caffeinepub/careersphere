The landing page includes the hero section with proper branding, navigation, and CTA button (REQ-1). All 8 module cards are implemented with icons, descriptions, and explore buttons in a responsive grid (REQ-2). Individual pages exist for Career Path with dropdown selector (REQ-3), Stream Selector Quiz (REQ-4), India vs Abroad comparison with visual indicators (REQ-5), Chatbot interface (REQ-6), FutureMap visual journey (REQ-7), Degree Finder with search (REQ-8), About section with problem statement and mission/vision (REQ-9), Contact form with validation and footer social links (REQ-10), and consistent modern UI design with blue/purple gradients and responsive layouts (REQ-11). Two module placeholders (Regional Language and AR Explorer) link back to the modules page as specified in non-goals.",
