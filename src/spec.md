# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix logo placement and positioning in Navigation and Home components to ensure proper alignment and spacing.

**Planned changes:**
- Reposition logo in Navigation.tsx to appear left of 'CareerSphere' text with proper spacing and vertical alignment
- Reposition logo in Home.tsx hero section to appear centered above the title with adequate spacing
- Verify logo file path references are correct in both components using absolute paths

**User-visible outcome:** The CareerSphere logo displays correctly positioned in the navigation header (left of text) and hero section (centered above title) with proper spacing and alignment across all screen sizes.
