- Add backend functions to save and retrieve Stream Selector quiz results linked to user principal IDs
- Add backend functions to bookmark and retrieve career paths and degree programs
- Auto-save quiz results when students complete the Stream Selector Quiz (if authenticated)
- Add bookmark buttons to Career Path and Degree Finder pages to save selections
- Create a Profile/Dashboard page showing saved quiz results, bookmarked careers, and bookmarked degrees
- Update Login page to explain authentication benefits and show user status
