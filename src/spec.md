# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the Subject-to-Career AR Explorer module so users can access it from the Modules page.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new SubjectToCareer.tsx page component with header, description, and placeholder content for AR features
- Add a '/subject-to-career' route in App.tsx to render the SubjectToCareer component
- Update the Subject-to-Career AR Explorer module card in Modules.tsx to link to the correct path

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click the "Explore" button on the Subject-to-Career AR Explorer module card and successfully navigate to a dedicated page explaining the module with placeholder content for upcoming AR features.
