# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the application from "career guide" to "CareerSphere" across all text references.

**Planned changes:**
- Update document title in index.html to "CareerSphere - Your Career Path Navigator"
- Replace "career guide" with "CareerSphere" in Home.tsx hero section
- Replace "career guide" with "CareerSphere" in About.tsx mission and vision statements
- Replace "career guide" with "CareerSphere" in all remaining frontend components
- Replace "career guide" with "CareerSphere" in backend code, comments, and documentation

**User-visible outcome:** The application displays "CareerSphere" consistently throughout the interface instead of "career guide", with updated branding in the browser title, homepage hero section, about page, and all other visible text.
