  "summary": "The diff only shows a modification to project_state.json (a metadata/state tracking file), with no actual code changes to backend/main.mo, any frontend TypeScript/React files, or deployment configuration files. None of the three requirements (REQ-108, REQ-109, REQ-110) appear to be implemented based on the available evidence.",

      "id": "REQ-108",
      "requirement": "Audit backend/main.mo for all Motoko compilation errors including incorrect type declarations, invalid HashMap stable storage patterns, missing or incorrect module imports, and malformed public function signatures. Fix every identified error so the file compiles cleanly.",
      "reason": "No changes to backend/main.mo are present in the diff. The only modified file is project_state.json, which is a metadata file and does not constitute a fix to the backend Motoko actor.",

      "reason": "No deployment configuration changes, canister IDs, or deployment artifacts are present in the diff. The prerequisite fixes for REQ-108 and REQ-109 are also absent, making deployment impossible.",
